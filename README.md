# 🌑 Late Night Code

Minimalist dark theme for Visual Studio Code (VS Code), designed for a comfortable night coding experience. Inspired by [**One Dark**](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax) and [**Default Dark Modern**](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/main/extensions/theme-defaults/themes/dark_modern.json) themes, every shade of **Late Night** was selected to provide maximum comfort and code readability - even during long night sessions! 😴
